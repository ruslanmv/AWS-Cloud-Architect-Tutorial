# Section 2: AWS - 10,000 Feet Overview

This section will cover a top-level overview on the AWS services tested in the Solutions Architect exam.

* AWS officially launched in 2006
* By the numbers, AWS services have grown from 82 in 2011 to over 1300+ in 2017

### Terminology
* What is a Region? A Region is a physical location in the world which consists of two or more AZ's
* What is an AZ? An AZ (Availability Zone) is simply a data center
* What is an Edge Location? Edge Locations are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's CDN (Content Delivery Network)
